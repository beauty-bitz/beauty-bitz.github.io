Upon approval of your comment, your profile picture/Avatar will be displayed publicly alongside your comment.

## How We Utilize Your Personal Information

The Site does not share, rent, or disclose your personal information to third parties without your prior consent, except as outlined in this privacy policy.

Your personal information may be utilized within the Site and related websites for various purposes, including transaction processing, communication, site improvement, enforcement of legal terms, protection of the Site and its stakeholders, and for other purposes indicated in our privacy policy.

Additionally, non-personally identifiable information may be utilized for site analysis, enhancing site design and content, delivering targeted marketing, personalizing user experiences, and providing products and services. In certain instances, IP addresses may be used to identify users for the enforcement of legal terms or protection of the Site and its stakeholders.

## Comment Information

We employ comment information to distinguish and identify you from other commenters, respond to your comments, and engage in communication with you.

## Email Information

Email information is utilized to communicate with you and furnish you with updates pertaining to our newly published content.

## Device Information

The data we collect aids in screening for potential risks and fraudulent activities, particularly through your IP address. Additionally, it assists us in enhancing and optimizing our Site. For instance, we generate analytics to understand how users browse and interact with the Site and evaluate the effectiveness of our marketing and advertising endeavors.

Your information is not traded or shared. Given that our site lacks any commercial functionalities, you won't receive any commerce-related communications from us.

## Analytics Statistics

Our analytics system collects data such as IP addresses, user IDs and usernames (if logged in), user agents, visiting and referring URLs, event timestamps, browser languages, and country codes. However, the site owner does not have access to this information. For instance, they can see the total views of a specific post but not the identities of individual visitors. The data, including visitor IP addresses and usernames (if available), is retained by the third-party service provider for 28 days solely for the purpose of facilitating this feature. We track post and page views, outbound link clicks, referring URLs, search engine terms, and countries. Additionally, the performance of each page load, including the JavaScript file used for tracking stats, is monitored.

To ensure compliance with GDPR, we utilize analytics software to understand how customers use our site:

• IP addresses are anonymized across all Google Analytics hits, eCommerce hits, and form tracking hits.

• User ID tracking is disabled across Google Analytics hits, eCommerce hits, form tracking hits, and the User ID.

• The ga() compatibility mode is enabled.

• Demographics and Interests Reports for Marketing and Advertising tracking on Google Analytics hits are disabled.

• AMP users are given the option to agree to the Google AMP Consent Box before being tracked.

For further information on how Google utilizes your Personal Information, please refer to their Privacy Policy [here](https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/). Additionally, you can opt-out of Google Analytics [here](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout).

## Search Feature:

The search feature utilizes visitor-selected search filters and query data to fulfill search requests. We incorporate aggregate data on page views and searches to refine our search results. This feature anonymously monitors visitor search activities, including search queries and clicks, to enhance our search algorithms and evaluate search performance. The tracking encompasses various data points such as IP addresses, URLs, user agents, event timestamps, browser languages, country codes, search queries, and filters.

## Share Buttons

When official sharing buttons are enabled on the site, each button fetches content directly from its respective service to display the button along with relevant information and tools for the sharing party. Consequently, each service may gather information about the sharing party. If a non-official Facebook, X (twitter) or Pinterest sharing button is activated on the site, data such as the sharing party's IP address and the page URL will be accessible to each service, enabling the display of sharing counts next to the button.

## Note Regarding GDPR

The personal data specified in Article 9 or Article 10 of the GDPR is not collected by the Site. Moreover, it does not partake in extensive and systematic monitoring of data subjects on a large scale.

Sharing Your Personal Information

Your Personal Information is shared with third parties only as described in this privacy policy statement. Disclosure may happen to adhere to legal obligations or to protect our rights and property.

Additionally, we may share your Personal Information to adhere to pertinent laws and regulations, respond to a subpoena, search warrant, or other lawful requests for information, or to safeguard our rights.
