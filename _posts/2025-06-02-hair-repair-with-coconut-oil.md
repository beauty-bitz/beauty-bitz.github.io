### Key Ingredients

#### 100% Virgin Coconut Oil:
Extracted from fresh coconut, 100% virgin coconut oil is a natural powerhouse for hair care. Rich in fatty acids, including lauric acid and vitamins E and K, this oil deeply penetrates the hair shaft to moisturize and nourish from within. Its emollient properties help to strengthen hair strands, reduce protein loss, and enhance shine, leaving your hair feeling soft, smooth, and lustrous.

#### Coconut Milk:
Luxuriously creamy and indulgent, coconut milk is a treasure trove of nutrients for your hair. Packed with vitamins, minerals, and proteins, coconut milk provides essential nourishment to dry, damaged hair. Its hydrating properties help to restore moisture balance, improve hair elasticity, and promote overall hair health. Additionally, the protein content in coconut milk helps to strengthen hair strands, reducing breakage and split ends, for hair that feels silky-soft and manageable.

#### Acacia Senegal:
Revered for its natural detangling abilities, Acacia Senegal is a botanical extract that works wonders for managing unruly hair. Its rich polysaccharide content forms a protective film around each hair strand, reducing friction and preventing tangling and knotting. This makes combing and styling easier, while also minimizing breakage and damage caused by tugging and pulling. With Acacia Senegal, you can enjoy smoother, more manageable hair with less effort and fewer frustrations.

#### Fair Trade Shea Butter:
Sustainably sourced from communities in West Africa, fair trade shea butter is a true multitasker for hair care. Renowned for its deeply hydrating and nourishing properties, shea butter is rich in vitamins, antioxidants, and fatty acids that promote hair strength, elasticity, and resilience. It forms a protective barrier in the hair shaft, sealing in moisture and shielding against environmental stressors and damage. Whether used as a leave-in conditioner, styling aid, or treatment, fair trade shea butter leaves hair feeling soft, silky, and replenished while supporting ethical and sustainable practices in its production.

### How I Like to Use It
1. Spray: Apply a generous amount of the treatment onto freshly washed, damp hair, paying special attention to the mid-lengths and ends.

2. Leave-In: I don't rinse it off! I let the product work its magic.

3. Style: Blow-dry or air-dry hair as usual.
